### Description

Object detection is a task in computer vision with many practical applications that can now be achieved with super-human levels of performance on selected benchmarks using deep neural networks.
In this talk we define the *object detection* task and present J. Redmon's YOLO (You Only Look Once) V3 deep neural network architecture.
As preliminaries to object detection and YOLOv3, we first describe image classification on the Pascal VOC and ImageNet benchmark datasets, and introduce a series of deep learning neural network architectures that include the multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and other networks with dystopian names such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet/Inception, VGG16, ResNet, and Region-CNN (R-CNN). 
We conclude with note of recent developments, including *capsule networks* (CapNets) by G. Hinton and deep networks with visual feedback.
Slides and notebooks with code will be available after the talk.

### Required files

#### `VGG16_Image_Classification.ipynb`
To train the custom output classifier of `VGG16_Image_Classification.ipynb`, a subset of the Kaggle dogs vs. cats data is needed, and the variable `kaggle_dogcats_dir` needs to be set to your local directory with the data (e.g.,  `'/your_datasets/dogs-vs-cats/'`). Your may download the data from:
* dogs vs. cats data: https://kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

The image data directory should have `test`, `train` and `validation` subdirectories, each with `cats` and `dogs` subdirectories.

#### `YOLOv3_Object_Detection.ipynb`
To run the `YOLOv3_Object_Detection.ipynb` notebook you must download the pre-trained `yolov3.weights` file from J. Redmon's site to a local directory on your machine, and change the variable `weights_path` in the second code cell of the notebook to your local directory.

Steps:
* Download `yolov3.weights` from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights.
* `weights_path = '/Your_Local_Directory_Models/yolov3.weights'`
